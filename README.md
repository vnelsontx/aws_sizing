# AWS Inventory Script for Commvault FETB Sizing

This script inventories AWS EC2 (EBS), EFS, RDS, and S3 resources across all active accounts in an AWS Organization.
It assumes a role into each account and collects capacity data for FETB (Front-End Terabytes) sizing.

## ‚úÖ Features
- Cross-account access via AWS Organizations and STS
- Inventories EC2 (via EBS), EFS, RDS, and S3
- Extracts resource counts, sizes, and tags
- Outputs a single Excel file with:
  - Summary tab: account, region, service, count, capacity
  - Tabs per service per account-region

## üîß Requirements

You need the following Python modules installed:
- `boto3`
- `openpyxl`

Install them using pip:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install boto3 openpyxl
```

### AWS IAM Requirements
The AWS credentials used to run this script **must be from the Management (payer) account** and must have:
- `organizations:ListAccounts`
- `sts:AssumeRole` on target accounts

Each target account **must have an IAM role** named:
```
OrganizationAccountAccessRole
```
...which is assumable by the management account.

This role should have at least the following permissions:
- `ec2:DescribeVolumes`
- `efs:DescribeFileSystems`
- `rds:DescribeDBInstances`
- `s3:ListAllMyBuckets`
- `s3:GetBucketLocation`
- `cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics`

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Script

```bash
python aws_inventory.py
```

If successful, the script will output:
- A JSON summary to the terminal
- An Excel workbook: `aws_inventory.xlsx` with detailed inventory and a summary tab

## üìÇ Output

- `aws_inventory.xlsx`  
  - `Summary` tab for account/region/service/count/capacity
  - One tab per service per account-region (e.g., `EC2_1234_useast1`)
